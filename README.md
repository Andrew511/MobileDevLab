# MobileDevLab
Lab collection for my mobile dev class

In this project I am developing a card game played on a android device that simulates the game of war,
in project things that are implemented involve a working chat between two players (not local) as well as matchmaking games between 
an uncertain amount of players.
scoring is also handled by the server as well as card validation and card visibility on the board.
